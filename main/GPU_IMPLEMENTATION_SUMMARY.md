# GPU-First Architecture Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New GPU Components Created

- **gpu_frame_distributor.py**: Thread-based frame distribution with pinned memory
- **gpu_face_processor.py**: End-to-end face processing on GPU
- **parallelworker_unified_gpu.py**: New worker implementation (now main)

### 2. Architecture Changes

**Before**: Multi-process with 10-15 CPU↔GPU transfers per frame
```
Camera → CPU → Queue → GPU → CPU → Queue → GPU → CPU → Queue → GPU → CPU
```

**After**: Thread-based with 2 transfers per frame
```
Camera → Pinned Memory → GPU → All Processing → Results to CPU
```

### 3. Key Improvements

1. **Pinned Memory**: 2-3x faster CPU→GPU transfers
2. **Thread-based GPU Processing**: Maintains CUDA context
3. **Pre-allocated Buffers**: No runtime allocation
4. **Batch Processing**: Multiple faces processed together
5. **Optimized Resizing**: GPU-based image resizing

### 4. Performance Expectations

- GPU Transfer: <3ms (down from 15-20ms)
- Face Processing: 15-25ms (down from 50-100ms)
- Total Latency: ~20ms (down from 50-100ms)
- Memory Usage: ~500MB GPU (stable)

### 5. Files Modified

- **parallelworker_unified.py**: Replaced with GPU version
- **youquantipy_config.json**: Added retinaface_trt_path
- **Backup created**: parallelworker_unified_original.py

### 6. Compatibility Maintained

- GUI requires no changes
- Same function signatures
- Pose processing unchanged
- LSL/Recording unchanged

## Testing Instructions

See `GPU_PIPELINE_TEST.md` for detailed testing steps.

## Important Notes

1. **TensorRT Engines Required**: Must have .trt files
2. **GPU Required**: No CPU fallback in this version
3. **Debug Mode**: Currently enabled for monitoring
4. **Thread Safety**: GPU operations in same thread

## Next Steps

1. Run tests with `python gui.py`
2. Monitor performance metrics
3. Disable debug mode for production
4. Fine-tune batch sizes if needed

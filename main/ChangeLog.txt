Abandoning this advanced CPU implementation for now.
This has the participant tracking via embeddings(not tested) and face detection/ROI tracking features. The reason for abandoning was that while the final intended architecture was working, the cropping of images for ROI to feed the landmarkers was getting too slow in higher resolutions. This created a bottleneck of readaing 1080p to 4k frames.  A smart resolution selection and a frame broadcasting server was implemented to remedy this. The ROI were cropped from downsampled images if they were larger (closer faces), increasing in resolution as the face size (distance increased) got smaller. This version shows visualizations in the GUI (downstream functions still broken) but it is not fast enough anyways. Hence the switch to GPU.

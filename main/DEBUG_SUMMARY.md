# YouQuantiPy Enhanced Mode Debugging Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Data Format Mismatch**: The fusion process was sending `face_data` and `pose_data` but the GUI expects `faces` and `all_poses`
   - Fixed by changing the preview_data keys in parallelworker_unified.py

2. **Missing ID Field**: The GUI's canvasdrawing.py expects faces to have an `id` field, but the fusion process was only setting `global_id`
   - Fixed by adding `face['id'] = face['global_id']` for both enhanced and standard modes

3. **Frame Counter Not Incrementing**: The fusion process frame_count was not being incremented
   - Fixed by adding `frame_count += 1` in the main loop

## Debug Output Added

### Face Worker Process (Enhanced Mode)
- Line 241-242: Prints enhanced mode status and component availability
- Line 385-386: Prints frame resolution info and enhanced processing status
- Line 429-430: Prints number of tracked objects being processed every 30 frames
- Line 444: Prints track ID, bbox, and ROI extraction success
- Line 498: Prints detected face info (centroid and landmark count)

### Fusion Process
- Line 805-806: Added handling for 'set_mesh' messages
- Line 840, 861: Prints number of faces processed in enhanced/standard mode every 30 frames
- Line 917-922: Prints preview data being sent (faces, poses, frame presence)
- Added face sample key debugging to show what fields are present

### Key Changes Made

1. **Preview Data Format**:
   ```python
   # Changed from:
   preview_data = {
       'face_data': latest_face_data,
       'pose_data': latest_pose_data
   }
   # To:
   preview_data = {
       'faces': latest_face_data,
       'all_poses': latest_pose_data
   }
   ```

2. **ID Field Addition**:
   ```python
   # Enhanced mode:
   face['id'] = face['global_id']
   # Standard mode:
   face['id'] = i + 1
   ```

3. **Mesh State Tracking**:
   - Added `enable_mesh = False` to fusion process state
   - Added message handler for 'set_mesh' control messages

## Expected Debug Output

When running in enhanced mode, you should see:

1. **Startup**:
   ```
   [FACE WORKER] Starting in ENHANCED mode
   [FACE WORKER DEBUG] Enhanced mode: True
   [FACE WORKER DEBUG] Components available: True
   ```

2. **Every 30 frames**:
   ```
   [FACE WORKER DEBUG] Frame 30: Processing 2 tracked objects
   [FACE WORKER DEBUG] Track 1: bbox=(100, 200), ROI extracted: True
   [FACE WORKER DEBUG] Detected face with centroid: (0.5, 0.4), 478 landmarks
   [FUSION DEBUG] Enhanced mode: 2 faces processed
   [FUSION DEBUG] Sending preview: 2 faces, 0 poses, frame: True
   [FUSION DEBUG] Face sample keys: ['track_id', 'landmarks', 'blend', 'centroid', 'mesh', 'timestamp', 'bbox', 'confidence', 'quality_score', 'global_id', 'id']
   [FUSION DEBUG] Face has 478 landmarks
   [FUSION DEBUG] Face id: 1
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Run the application and check if:
   - Enhanced mode is actually being activated (check for "ENHANCED mode" in output)
   - ROI extraction is happening (look for "ROI extracted: True")
   - Preview data has the correct format (check "Face sample keys" output)
   - Overlays are being drawn (GUI should show face landmarks)

2. If overlays still don't show:
   - Check if `frame_bgr` is being sent with preview data
   - Verify canvas drawing manager is receiving faces with correct format
   - Check if coordinates are being transformed correctly from ROI to full frame

3. If full frames are still being sent to face workers:
   - The enhanced mode SHOULD send full frames to the frame distributor
   - ROI extraction happens inside the face worker after tracking
   - This is the expected behavior - ROIs are extracted from tracked regions
